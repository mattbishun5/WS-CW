Year Evaluation

It has been a year of learning for me having had very little javascript experience. What gave me the reason to choose this unit was WEBF1 last year, where we had to design a website. I found that to be a throughly enjoyable unit. I have found Javascrtipt to be very challenging, and although I have not done as well as I thought I could have, I have enjoyed learning about the language.

The first 6 weeks leading up to the first hack, involved me going through each lab, week by week and creating functions which would pass a series of tests. I found some functions, particularly more difficult than others, which was all part of the learning experience. I had help from peers and my tutors and was able to become confident in creating functions to pass tests, as this is something that would be required for the Week 6 48hr hack, the first Coursework of the unit.
