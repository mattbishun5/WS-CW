Year Evaluation

It has been a year of learning for me having had very little javascript experience. What gave me the reason to choose this unit was WEBF1 last year, where we had to design a website. I found that to be a throughly enjoyable unit. I have found Javascrtipt to be very challenging, and although I have not done as well as I thought I could have, I have enjoyed learning about the language.

The first 6 weeks leading up to the first hack, involved me going through each lab, week by week and creating functions which would pass a series of tests. I found some functions, particularly more difficult than others, which was all part of the learning experience. I had help from peers and my tutors and was able to become confident in creating functions to pass tests, as this is something that would be required for the Week 6 48hr hack, the first Coursework of the unit. 

The first coursework went okay, but looking back on my code now I included unnecessary, commented code which was of no benefit. It would have been better to not have the code in there. I also included too many blank lines, and I didnt comment my code enough. This was a learning experience.

The next 6 weeks leading up to the Xmas break involved using node.js, as the next coursework was a Server side challenge. I enjoyed this side more than the client side, and enabled me to interact with the terminal (I use a Mac) to run the npm (node package manager). Again, it was a learning experience and I took on board the comments from the Week 6 CW hack.

The period after Xmas was about leading up to the final application. Drag and drop, along with CSS Grid Layout would be requirements for the final application due at Easter. I took time out of hours to learn the drag and drop and implement it into my code, and I found this helped me massively in the end product. I could have spent more time on the final application if I had started a bit earlier with the coding, however other coursework got in the way of this. For next time, I will plan this a little better. However, I believe I have put in the effort to gain a good mark in my final assessment.


The end product I believe I am happy with, having developed my HTML and CSS knowledge from last year.
